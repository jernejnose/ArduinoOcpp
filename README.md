[![Build Status]( https://github.com/matth-x/ArduinoOcpp/workflows/PlatformIO%20CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/matth-x/ArduinoOcpp/actions)

OCPP-J 1.6 client for embedded microcontrollers. Portable C/C++. Compatible with Espressif, NXP, Texas Instruments and STM.

Reference usage: [OpenEVSE](https://github.com/OpenEVSE/ESP32_WiFi_V4.x/blob/master/src/ocpp.cpp)

PlatformIO package: [ArduinoOcpp](https://platformio.org/lib/show/11975/ArduinoOcpp)

Website: [www.arduino-ocpp.com](https://www.arduino-ocpp.com)

Fully integrated into the Arduino platform and the ESP32 / ESP8266. Runs on ESP-IDF, FreeRTOS and generic embedded C/C++ platforms.

## Make your EVSE ready for OCPP :car::electric_plug::battery:

This library allows your EVSE to communicate with an OCPP Backend and to participate in commercial charging networks. You can integrate it into an existing firmware development, or start a new EVSE project from scratch with it.

:heavy_check_mark: Works with [SteVe](https://github.com/RWTH-i5-IDSG/steve), [The Mobility House OCPP package](https://github.com/mobilityhouse/ocpp) and further commercial Central Systems

:heavy_check_mark: Tested in many charging stations

:heavy_check_mark: Eligible for public chargers (Eichrecht-compliant)

### Features

- handles the OCPP communication with the charging network
- implements the standard OCPP charging process
- provides an API for the integration of the hardware modules of your EVSE
- works with any TLS implementation and WebSocket library. E.g.
   - Arduino networking stack: [Links2004/arduinoWebSockets](https://github.com/Links2004/arduinoWebSockets), or
   - generic embedded systems: [Mongoose Networking Library](https://github.com/cesanta/mongoose)

For simple chargers, the necessary hardware and internet integration is usually far below 1000 LOCs.

## Developers guide

Please take `examples/ESP/main.cpp` as the starting point for your first project. It is a minimal example which shows how to establish an OCPP connection and how to start and stop charging sessions. The API documentation can be found in [`ArduinoOcpp.h`](https://github.com/matth-x/ArduinoOcpp/blob/master/src/ArduinoOcpp.h).

### Dependencies

Mandatory:

- [bblanchon/ArduinoJSON](https://github.com/bblanchon/ArduinoJson) (please upgrade to version `6.19.1`)

If compiled with the Arduino integration:

- [Links2004/arduinoWebSockets](https://github.com/Links2004/arduinoWebSockets) (please upgrade to version `2.3.6`)

In case you use PlatformIO, you can copy all dependencies from `platformio.ini` into your own configuration file. Alternatively, you can install the full library with dependencies by adding `matth-x/ArduinoOcpp` in the PIO library manager.

### Next development steps

- [x] reach full compliance to OCPP 1.6 Smart Charging Profile
- [ ] integrate Authorization Cache
- [ ] **get ready for OCPP 2.0.1 and ISO 15118**

## Supported Feature Profiles

| Feature profile | supported | in progress |
| -------------- | :---------: | :-----------: |
| **Core** | :heavy_check_mark: |
| **Smart charging** | :heavy_check_mark: |
| **Remote trigger** | :heavy_check_mark: |
| **Firmware management** | :heavy_check_mark: |

## Further help

I hope this guide can help you to successfully integrate an OCPP controller into your EVSE. If something needs clarification or if you have a question, please send me a message.
